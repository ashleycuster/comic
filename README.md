Base for React application with D3 visualizations 
======

## Sources 
The base of this React application is the demo from Cory House's Pluralsight course, [Building Applications with React and Flux](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/react-flux-building-applications). 

The initial code of combining React and D3 was inspired by A Sharif's [Reusable Chart Components with React and D3](http://busypeoples.github.io/post/d3-with-react-js/)

The D3 Sunburst visualization was created using [Hierarchie](https://github.com/mlvl/Hierarchie) by the data visualization team for [DECISIVE ANALYTICS Corporation](http://www.dac.us), Sequences Sunburst](http://bl.ocks.org/kerryrodden/7090426) by Kerry Rodden, and [Zoomable Sunburst](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4348373) by Mike Bostock.
