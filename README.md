## Sources 
The base of this React application is a modification the demo from Cory House's Pluralsight course, [Building Applications with React and Flux](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/react-flux-building-applications). 

The initial code of combining React and D3 was inspired by Freddy Rangel's [Playing with React and D3](https://github.com/freddyrangel/playing-with-react-and-d3).

The D3 Sunburst visualization was created using [Hierarchie](https://github.com/mlvl/Hierarchie) by the data visualization team for [DECISIVE ANALYTICS Corporation](http://www.dac.us), [Sequences Sunburst](http://bl.ocks.org/kerryrodden/7090426) by Kerry Rodden, and [Zoomable Sunburst](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4348373) by Mike Bostock.
